## About this project

This App was built for a local in home kids learning center. The eniqueness of this application is that it is build as single page application using Angular 9. This application was designed to give information to potential parents of the children. Because all of the classes are happening in Russian, web bage needed to have button that switches information blocks from English to Russian. 
Web application cosists of three routes. First route is About, where user can view inormation about learning center in both Russian and English languages. Second route is gallery, where user can view fotos and video. Third page is contact page that is linked to e-mail. 
For future development, we will be adding login route where member staff of the learning center will be able to update a message on the web site and upload new photos and videos. And may send information from customers that are trying to contact through our contact form.
